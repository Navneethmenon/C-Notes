FLOW CHART

Definition :
A flowchart is a graphic representation of how a process works, showing, at a minimum, the sequence of steps.
 
A program flowchart is the simplest way to figure out the bugs in a program before carrying out,
saving a lot of time, labor, and money. This article will introduce the program flowchart definition
from many aspects and hope it will help programmers in future program flowchart drawing.
The program flowchart is a diagram that uses a set of standard graphic symbols to represent the sequence of coded 
instructions fed into a computer, enabling it to perform specified logical and arithmetical operations.
 It is a great tool to improve work efficiency. There are four basic symbols in the program flowchart, 
start, process, decision, and end. Each symbol represents a piece of the code written for the program.
 
 ADVANTAGES : 

Program flowchart can help programmers to find the bug in the process before carrying out.
It works as a blueprint when analyzing the systems and developing programs, which makes coding more efficient.
It improves programmersâ€™ efficiency in maintaining the operating program.
With the help of program flowchart, communicating the logic of a system to all concerned gets much easier.
 
 Smart drawing of it enables users to connect, align and space shapes automatically.
