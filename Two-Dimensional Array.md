Two-Dimensional Array
1. the essential sort of declaring a two-dimensional array of size x, y: ...
2. we will declare a two dimensional integer array say 'x' of size 10,20 as: ...
3. Elements in two-dimensional arrays are commonly referred by x[i][j] where i is the row number and 'j' is the column
number
Why do we use two dimensional arrays?
A two-dimensional array also can be wont to store objects, which is particularly convenient for programming sketches

that involve some kind of "grid" or "board." the subsequent example displays a grid of Cell objects stored during a two-
dimensional array

What are two dimensional arrays?
A 2D array features a type like int[][] or String[][], with two pairs of square brackets. ... the weather of a 2D array are
arranged in rows and columns, and therefore the new operator for 2D arrays specifies both the amount of rows and the
number of columns.
Limitations of 2d arrays
Limitations of arrays, that occupies an amount of memory for proportional to its size, the amount of elements that are
literally of interest;
Limitations of Array : Array is Static arrangement and memory can't be allocated at run time. Deletion and Insertion
Operation on Array is Difficult.
Limitations of Array in C Programming, arrangement can hold data belonging to same data type. Limitations of arrays.
We have seen that we will use arrays whenever we've to store and manipulate collections of elements. the dimension
of an array is about the instant the array is made , and can't be changed later on;
Limitations of models of ions and ionic compounds, - it doesn't show where the ions are located on the opposite layers.
2D arrays are used to represent matrices.
Advantages:
It can be used to implement other data structures like linked It allows us to store known number of elements in it. So It
allocates the memory in the contiguous memory locations for its elements. It doesn't allocate any extra space/ memory
for its elements. Hence there's no memory overflow or shortage of memory in arrays.
Disadvantages:
1. We must know beforehand that what percentage elements are to be stored in array.
2. Array is static structure. It means that array is of fixed size
3. The memory which is allocated to array can not be increased or reduced.
How To declare two dimensional array and its Initialization
Two – dimensional Array (2D-Array)
Declaration –
Syntax: data_type[][] array_name = new data_type[x][y];

Page 1

For example: int[][] arr = new int[20][10];
Initialization –
Syntax: array_name[row_index][column_index] = value;
For example: arr[0][0] = 1
